### Description

This is a carbon copy of the Microsoft Calculator really, it functions just like it. I owe a great deal to Mr. Ian Williams for his help on coding much of this. I have added a few other functions or enhancements that some of the other Calculator applications have on them. The Scientific portion still needs to be coded.
 
### More Info
 
Works like a Calculator.
